# SQL - More queries

In this project, I continued to practicing SQL queries, working with
permissoins, joins, and constraints.

## Usage :dolphin:

* Scripts [3-force_name.sql](./3-force_name.sql) forward take the database to query from
as a MySQL command line argument.

```
$ cat 3-force_name.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0d_2
```
